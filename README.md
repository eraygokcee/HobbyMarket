# HobbyMarket
"Hobby Market" is a Java-based application designed to manage and facilitate hobby-related purchases, sales, or interactions. This project contains both the backend logic in Java and the SQL schema for database management.
# Contribution
## SQL Development
I contributed to this project by developing the SQL scripts. This includes the creation of database tables, relationships, and essential queries that power the application's data layer.

The Java codebase was primarily developed by other team members, while my focus was on ensuring the database design aligns with the application's requirements.
